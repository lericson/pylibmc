    This is mostly useful in threaded environments, because a client isn't

    its own client, but you don't want to reconnect these all the time.

    The solution is a pool, and this class is a helper for that.

    In a threaded environment, you'd most likely want to have a client per
    thread. And there'd be no harm in one thread keeping the same client at all
    times. So, why not map threads to clients? That's what this class does.

    If a client is reserved, this class checks for a key based on the current
    thread, and if none exists, clones the master client and inserts that key.

    Of course this requires that you let the pool know when a thread is done
    with its reserved instance, so therefore ``relinquish`` must be called
    before thread exit.
