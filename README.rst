New in version 1.0
------------------

- Lots of documentation fixes and other nice things like that.
- Nailed what appears to be the last outstanding memory leak.
- Explicitly require libmemcached 0.32 or newer.

New in version 0.9
------------------

- Added a ``get_stats`` method, which behaves exactly like
  `python-memcached`'s equivalent.
- Gives the empty string for empty memcached values like `python-memcached`
  does.
- Added exceptions for most `libmemcached` return codes.
- Fixed an issue with ``Client.behaviors.update``.

New in version 0.8
------------------

- Pooling helpers are now available. See ``pooling.rst`` in the distribution.
- The binary protocol is now properly exposed, simply pass ``binary=True`` to
  the constructor and there you go.
- Call signatures now match `libmemcached` 0.32, but should work with older
  versions. Remember to run the tests!

New in version 0.7
------------------

- Restructured some of the code, which should yield better performance (if not
  for that, it reads better.)
- Fixed some memory leaks.
- Integrated changes from `amix.dk`, which should make pylibmc work under
  Snow Leopard.
- Add support for the boolean datatype.
- Improved test-runner -- now tests ``build/lib.*/_pylibmc.so`` if available,
  and reports some version information.
- Support for x86_64 should now work completely.
- Builds with Python 2.4, tests run fine, but not officially supported.
- Fixed critical bugs in behavior manipulation.

New in version 0.6
------------------

- Added compatibility with `libmemcached` 0.26, WRT error return codes.
- Added `flush_all` and `disconnect_all` methods.
- Now using the latest pickling protocol.

New in version 0.5
------------------

- Fixed lots of memory leaks, and added support for `libmemcached` 0.23.
- Also made the code tighter in terms of compiler pedantics.

New in version 0.4
------------------

- Renamed the C module to `_pylibmc`, and added lots of `libmemcached` constants
  to it, as well as implemented behaviors.
