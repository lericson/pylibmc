New in version 1.3.0
====================

Because there ain't nothing better than releasing software in the spring time.

Lots of improvements have come about in just about every corner of the library,
thanks to *eighteen different authors* over almost *20 pull requests*. Amazing.

- Added touch support
- Added compress_level
- Added weighted distribution
- Added automated benchmarking utility
- Added Travis CI and build status
- Added behavior dead_timeout
- Added behaviors tcp_keepalive
- Added behavior callback_prefix_key
- Lots of bug tuning, fixes, tests, and documentation

Last but not least I would like to ask for your support in this project, either
by helping out with development, testing, documentation or anything at all; or
simply by donating some `magic internet money`__ to the project's Bitcoin
address `12dveKhqiJWCY8zXT4kaHdHELXPeGAUo9h`__
